	<h1>WHY GO SOLAR IN MASSACHUSETTS NOW?</h1>
	<h2>Save Money</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>MA has some of the highest electricity rates in the country and they continue to rise! Solar is less expensive than what the utility company charges, AND you will control your cost for decades to come.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Increase the Value of your Home</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You put a lot of time, energy, and money into maintaining your home. Now is a time to use what you have to your advantage.</li></ul>
		<h2>Solar incentives are going away</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>There are <a href="http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program?state=MA" target="_blank">Federal &amp; State incentives</a> that will be expiring in the near future. There may never be a better time to go solar than right now</li>
		</ul>
